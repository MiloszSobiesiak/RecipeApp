## Technologies
-Angular<br>
-Firebase Authentication<br>
-Realtime Database<br>

Logging in and creating an account is done using the authorization firebase. Realtime Database was used as the database. The HTTP module is responsible for communication with the data request.

## Instruction 
At the moment, it is not possible to delete or edit recipes (it is related to database problems). When creating a new plan, delete the old one, complete all fields and create a new one. It is not possible to edit, in case of a mistake you have to start over.
